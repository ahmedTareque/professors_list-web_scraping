## Looking for MS/PHD Funding in Computer Science

<p align="center">
  Well, I was looking around professors in different universities for funding in <b>Machine learning, UAV(Drone)</b>, it became difficult to track them and keep them in excel. Rather than, I made this repository to web scrape professors list from University website. Professors from several Universities' web scraping queries are available here. Updated until August, 2024.

## Happy coding!
